Each qualified beneficiary who elects continuation coverage will have the same rights under the Plan as other participants or beneficiaries covered under the Plan, such as changing coverage under the Plan during open enrollment or other special enrollment rights. The persons who have been identified by the Plan as qualified beneficiaries entitled to elect continuation coverage are listed on the cover letter sent with this Notice.</p>"
