Many times, you will continue to use the same insurance card you used while on the group health plan as an active employee. Upon receipt of your proper payment, CCS will notify the appropriate parties to reinstate your coverage. The timing of the reactivation of your coverage depends on your plan and the insurance carrier. Most COBRA coverage is reactivated within 7 to 10 business days of CCS&apos; receipt of your proper payment. To verify if your coverage is active, please contact the insurance carrier (the number on the back of your insurance card) directly.</p>"
